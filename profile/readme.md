## ðŸš€ Quick Start Guide

### Step 1: Run the Java Server

The **Java Server** is the backend that powers the dashboard system. Follow these steps to get it up and running:

1. **Download the ZIP file** from the [Java-Server](https://github.com/RevealBI-JavaBuilder/Java-Server) repository.
2. **Unzip the file** into your desired directory.
3. Open a terminal, navigate to the unzipped directory, and run the following command:
   ```bash
   ./mvnw spring-boot:run
   ```
   *For Windows users:*  
   ```bash
   mvnw.cmd spring-boot:run
   ```

4. The server will start at `http://localhost:5111`.
